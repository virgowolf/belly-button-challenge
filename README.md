## Interactive Data Visualization with d3 and JavaScript
This project was completed for the UC Berkeley Data Analytics and Data Visualization Bootcamp in May 2024.
I utilized JavaScript to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
Users can select a sample from a dropdown menu to view an interactive bubble chart. The webpage also includes a horizontal bar chart with the top 10 sample values.

## Running the code
To run the code, open the js file and html file in VS Code and preview the html file with your browser.
The data are also viewable on the following webpage, hosted by GitLab: https://virgowolf.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
